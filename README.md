# 🤖 Build a Neural Network from Scratch

## About
In the last lesson, we learned how to use gradient descent to train a linear regression algorithm. In this lesson, we'll build on this to make a multi-layer neural network.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/syed-muqtasid-ali/neural-network-from-scratch.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd neural-network-from-scratch
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🚀 Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook file `build_neural_network_from_scratch.ipynb` to follow along with the lesson and build the neural network.

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. Open the `build_neural_network_from_scratch.ipynb` file and execute the cells to build and train the neural network.

## 📊 Examples

Here are a few examples of what you can do with this project:

1. **Building the Network:**
    - Follow step-by-step instructions in the notebook to construct a multi-layer neural network from scratch.

2. **Training the Network:**
    - Use gradient descent and backpropagation algorithms to train the neural network on a dataset.

3. **Evaluating Performance:**
    - Evaluate the performance of your neural network using various metrics such as accuracy.
